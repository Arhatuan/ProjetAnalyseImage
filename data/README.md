# Content of 'data' folder

It must contain at least 2 files and 1 directory :
- the file '***default_ground_truth.txt***', that contains the ground truth data for the images
- the file '***default_imgs_to_evaluate.txt***', that contains the list of images to apply the regression algorithm and then evaluate
- the directory '***img_database***', that contains all the necessary images

These files and directory are necessary for the automatic use of the program (without having to give, on the command line, alternative files and folder with the same usage).
